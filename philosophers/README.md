The philosophers project is a programming exercise from School 42.

It challenges students to solve the dining philosophers problem using multithreading in the C programming language. The problem requires students to write a program that simulates a group of philosophers sitting around a circular table, each thinking or eating. The philosophers must share a limited number of forks to eat their meals, but they cannot eat if they only have one fork and cannot obtain a second one. The challenge is to develop a solution that ensures all the philosophers can eat without causing deadlock and data-races. Oh and ideally, all the philosophers survive their lunch.

Main themes: synchronization and resource allocation in multithreaded environments. 
Special focus: Mutexes, semaphores, and other synchronization primitives. Creative algorithm development for low-level programming problems.
