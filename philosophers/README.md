# Pipex

# Project Overview
The Pipex project involves creating a command-line program that mimics the behavior of the shell command pipeline (|). It takes two commands and redirects the output of the first command as the input of the second command, emulating the behavior of the shell's pipe operator.

# Key Features
The Pipex project includes the following key features:

Command Execution: 
Pipex allows users to execute two commands, just like in a shell pipeline. It handles the execution of the commands and sets up the appropriate file descriptors for input/output redirection.

Input/Output Redirection: 
Pipex supports input and output redirection using file descriptors. It allows users to specify input and output files for the commands, redirecting their standard input/output accordingly.

File Creation and Permissions: The program handles the creation of output files and sets the appropriate permissions for the newly created files.

Error Handling: Pipex provides error handling mechanisms for various scenarios, such as invalid commands, file-related errors, and failures during command execution.

# Getting Started
To get started with Pipex, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Compile the source code using the provided makefile.
Run the resulting executable, providing the appropriate command-line arguments for input and output files, as well as the two commands to execute.
Pipex will execute the commands and redirect the input/output according to the specified file descriptors.
