# Project Overview
The Philosophers project involves creating a program that simulates the dining philosophers problem. The goal is to design a solution that allows the philosophers to alternate between thinking and eating while avoiding deadlocks and resource starvation.

# Key Features
The Philosophers project includes the following key features:

Concurrency Management: 
The program manages multiple philosophers as separate threads or processes. It handles thread/process creation, synchronization, and communication.

Resource Allocation: 
The philosophers compete for limited resources (forks) placed between them on the table. They must acquire the necessary forks to eat and release them when finished to allow other philosophers to use them.

Deadlock Avoidance: 
The program implements a solution to avoid deadlocks, where philosophers are unable to make progress due to resource contention. It ensures that philosophers can acquire the necessary forks without causing a circular wait condition.

Starvation Prevention: 
The solution also addresses the issue of starvation, ensuring that no philosopher is indefinitely prevented from eating. It provides a fair allocation of resources to philosophers, allowing them to eventually acquire the forks.

# Getting Started
To get started with Philosophers, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Compile the source code using the provided makefile.
Run the resulting executable, specifying the number of philosophers and any other necessary parameters.
Observe the program's simulation of the dining philosophers problem and the philosophers' interactions.
