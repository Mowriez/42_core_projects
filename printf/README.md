The printf project is a programming exercise from School 42.

It teaches students how to implement their own version of the printf function in C. 
The task is to write a function that can format and print a small range of data types to the console, using format specifiers such as %d, %s, and %f.

This project was really fun and helped to practice important concepts in C programming, especially variable argument lists, 
string manipulation, and low-level I/O operations.
