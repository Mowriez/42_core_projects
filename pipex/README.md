The pipex project is a programming exercise from School 42. 

It teaches students how to work with pipes and file redirection in a Unix-like environment. 
The task is to write a program that simulates the behavior of the shell command pipeline for a narrow set of commands, allowing users to redirect 
input and output streams between multiple commands.

This project was a great way to practice important concepts in Unix programming, such as process management, file I/O, and signal handling. It was also the bane
of my existence, as the Error handling seemed to be quite erratic. This project is working and evaluated at 115%, but I'd say it's about 85% of what it 
should be in terms of hard-coded features and error-handling.
