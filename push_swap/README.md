The push_swap project is a programming exercise from School 42. 

It teaches students how to sort a stack of integers using only only a limited amount of stack operations and a second, empty stack.
The task is to write a program that takes an unsorted stack of integers as input and outputs a series of instructions that, when executed, 
will sort the stack in ascending order.

This project helped learning important concepts in algorithm design and complexity analysis, as well as developing my skills in C programming and problem solving. 
It also helped develop skills in parsing and the ability to handle edge cases, as the input could be quite diverse and catching all edge-cases was difficult.

My project uses a proprietary algorithm to sort up to 5 elements, and for bigger stacks it uses the radix sort algorithm applied to the binary representation of the 
numbers in a pre-indexed stack.
