The get_next_line project is a programming exercise from School 42.

It teaches students how to read input from a file descriptor and handle heap memory allocation in C. 

The task is to write a function that reads from a file descriptor in chunks of "Buffer size", dynamically allocates memory to store these chunks, and returns a line as
soon as a newline-character is found.

This project was a great way to practice important concepts in C programming such as memory allocation, file I/O, and static variables. 
It also helped developing problem-solving skills and attention to detail, as writing a robust and efficient function that handles all possible input cases
was quite challenging.

This repository contains my implementation of the getnextline function, along with a Makefile for compiling and testing the code.
