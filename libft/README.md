The libft project is a programming exercise from School 42.
It teaches students how to implement common functions from the C standard library and create their own library of utility functions in C. 
The task is to write a set of functions that cover a wide range of functionality, from basic string manipulation and memory allocation to more 
advanced data structures and input/output operations.

This project was a great way to practice important concepts in C programming, such as memory allocation, pointer arithmetic, and error handling.
t also helped me develop problem-solving skills and attention to detail, as writing a robust and efficient library that handles all possible input cases was
quite challenging, and I'm sure even with the project being successfully evaluated I missed a bunch of test-cases.
